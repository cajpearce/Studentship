Bugs:

+  Can't have spaces in directories


Thoughts:
  +	I find it quite confusing linking inputs to outputs. It doesn't seem natural.

Errors:
  +	> runPipeline(mandrought)
 	Error in readLines(findFile(ref, path)) : 'con' is not a connection
  ->	FIXED
  ->	Was an issue with capitalisation. Might pay to have a comparison script but I suppose it's up to the person to figure that one out




Error Reporting:
  + 	When reading in a file in the same directory as the original R script, it doesn't read it in.
	Glue system needs to be able to set working directory to the original location.
  +	When reading any kind of file, if it doesn't exist it should throw a meaningful error.
  +	Needs to check inputs and outputs

Notes:
  + 	Think you need to use cbind with dataframes rather than df$v1 = ...
  ->	SOLVED - not true. Screwed up my linkages. Fixed when fixed my copy and paste error
  +	Need to have the following packages
		ggplot2
		maptools
		gpclib

  +	Cannot read in directories for external files without user input
	  -	Is this a good thing?
		You probably wouldn't want a script that automatically picks up user directories
		Probably a good thing if users provide their own directories
	  -	BUT - there should be an option for users to skip this process and do it automatically
	  -	readline = automatically, file.choose=manually

Bugs:

  +	Can't have spaces in directories


Thoughts:
  +	I find it quite confusing linking inputs to outputs. It doesn't seem natural.
(28 Nov 15:08)	I would like to be able to provide inline source as an input - so I don't have to create 2 XML files just to customise the input. See directoryprompt.r


Error Reporting:
  + 	When reading in a file in the same directory as the original R script, it doesn't read it in.
	Glue system needs to be able to set working directory to the original location.
  +	When reading any kind of file, if it doesn't exist it should throw a meaningful error.
  +	Needs to check inputs and outputs

Day 2:
	Started working on PyGlue
	Working with namespaces is absolutely awful in python
	Wondering if it would be easier to not use the namespace

  -	Going to work on using lxml etree
	Apparently it has better processing regarding namespaces that make more
	sense :)

  ?	Why are we using namespaces? We're not really using them to any benefit

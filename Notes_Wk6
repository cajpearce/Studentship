Day 1:
	Managed to read in all the data from LINZ! stoked
	Took all of Thurs/Friday last week trying to figure it out.
	Wasn't working fully properly because I didn't quite understand tryCatch
	Also struggled because I forgot to turn the data.frames into lists

Day 2:
	Realising that the data is better as zoo instead of ts
	This isn't a 'regular' time series. The seasonal effects are contained
	in the actual data itself. I don't know what these effects are


  -	Should I go back and get rid of the identifier from the datasets, and 
	add it as the list grabber (column name???)

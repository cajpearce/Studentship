Day 1:
	Auckland Anniversary!

Day 2:
	Struggling at the thought of passing variables across
	Currently have a list with assignment, and position (0 = start, 1 = end)
  -	[  ('df = INPUT_XML_test2_xml_df', 0), 
	('arty = test2_xml_OUTPUT_XML_arty', 1)]
	
	Taken from test3.xml
	However, in the OpenAPI system, you don't need to keep variable names
	consistent, so will have to edit this to make sure that you can pass
	variable names across

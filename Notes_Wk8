Day 1:
	Auckland Anniversary!

Day 2:
	Struggling at the thought of passing variables across
	Currently have a list with assignment, and position (0 = start, 1 = end)
  -	[  ('df = INPUT_XML_test2_xml_df', 0), 
	('arty = test2_xml_OUTPUT_XML_arty', 1)]
	
	Taken from test3.xml
	However, in the OpenAPI system, you don't need to keep variable names
	consistent, so will have to edit this to make sure that you can pass
	variable names across


Day 4:
	My birthday!
	
  -	Discussed with Paul - 2 issues
  1.	Modules that extend plots
	Impossible to implement at the moment, without enforcing ggplot2
	Need some way to figure out how to pass plots around
  2.	Empty pipes - having pipes without variable definitions

  -	IMPORTANT - next update.
	Need to imitate rm(list=ls()) after assigning variables in python

Day 5:
Thought process:
  -	Pipeline needs to get 'start' modules
	From module, need to get inputs, if none, get outputs and pass back to
	function for recursive behaviour
	Also need to use the pipes???

	So, topographic sort gives the order
	Component_dict gives the connections


  -	FIRST Hurdle - was assuming there was only one input and output module

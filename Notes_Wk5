Day 1: finished off fiscal, started drawing in more Govt. spending.

Day 2:
	Started writing a pipeline for fiscal using just the functions provided
	in conduit. Seems to be in the correct format (verified by Ashley) but
	comes up with an error.
	Error in components[[startComponent]] : invalid subscript type 'list'

	Trying to figure out what's causing it

Notes:
  + 	Think you need to use cbind with dataframes rather than df$v1 = ...
  ->	SOLVED - not true. Screwed up my linkages. Fixed when fixed my copy and paste error

Bugs:

  +	Can't have spaces in directories


Thoughts:
  +	I find it quite confusing linking inputs to outputs. It doesn't seem natural.



Error Reporting:
  + 	When reading in a file in the same directory as the original R script, it doesn't read it in.
	Glue system needs to be able to set working directory to the original location.
  +	When reading any kind of file, if it doesn't exist it should throw a meaningful error.
  +	Needs to check inputs and outputs

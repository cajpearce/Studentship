Notes:
  +	Finding prettyCSV function remove1Drows really useful - in Inflation
	I've turned it into its own module - I've found it useful everywhere
  +	Packages needed:
		zoo (for formatting year months)
		gdata (for reading in excel documents)


  +	BUG
		expected '>'
		Premature end of data in tag pipeline line 2
		Error: 1: expected '>'
		2: Premature end of data in tag pipeline line 2
	Happened when I accidentally forgot to close </pipe> tag
	Should give a more indicative warning


Friday
  +	Working on converting 'Inflation' into 'PyFlation'
  +	Currently need:
		pip
		sudo pip install xlrd
		sudo pip install xlwt
  +	Pandas wouldn't install on here :(
  +	Python is so difficult

  +	Can't get anything to work in Python
	Will have another go after the weekend. Tried my best but python
	documentation is so hard to navigate.

Log:
	Started in xlrd, couldn't figure out how to read in
	opened up urllib2, read in a socket, read into xlrd
	Couldn't figure out how to remove columns, moved to pandas
	pandas doesn't work either
	PYTHON MIGHT BE USER FRIENDLY BUT BY GOD IT'S NOT DEVELOPER FRIENDLY

Notes:
  +	Finding prettyCSV function remove1Drows really useful - in Inflation
	I've turned it into its own module - I've found it useful everywhere
  +	Packages needed:
		zoo (for formatting year months)
		gdata (for reading in excel documents)


  +	BUG
		expected '>'
		Premature end of data in tag pipeline line 2
		Error: 1: expected '>'
		2: Premature end of data in tag pipeline line 2
	Happened when I accidentally forgot to close </pipe> tag
	Should give a more indicative warning
